To learn to code
When you turn 53 you realize the importance of learning need items. Especially now, it is an important part of your everyday routine to learn something new. I guess you are always learning but I need to make it a conscious effort to commit to a continuos journey. My grandad turned 103 last year and he cheerfully announced he was on his way to 104. When I was 20 or 30 or 40 it was a given that I would live for another year. My grandfather has now taught me that you cannot take it for granted. And when I think that I have 50something years to go, well learning is all more important.
I want to code and understand better how customer service is evolving to a tech oriented business.
